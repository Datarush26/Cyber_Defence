				 				<p>A phishing website is a fraudulent site designed to mimic a legitimate website with the intent of deceiving visitors into divulging sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal details.<br/>
									Example:
									A phishing website might look almost identical to a bank's official website. It could have the same logo, layout, and design. However, when users enter their login credentials, this information is captured by the attackers instead of being securely transmitted to the bank.
									Phishing Website Characteristics:
									URL Differences: The web address may have slight variations from the legitimate site (e.g., www.bank-example.com vs. www.bank-exampple.com).<br/>
